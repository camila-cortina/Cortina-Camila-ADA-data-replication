## Introduction
```
The paper, Multi-scalar drivers of biodiversity: local management mediates wild bee community response to regional urbanization, by Ballare et al., that I am reanalysing data from collected bees from 40 sites. 20 of the sites are managed as agricultural sites, and 20 of them are maintained as grasslands. The study primarily wanted to see if there was an interaction between local and landscape level complexity by using data collected in a 50x50m plot (local) such as % bare ground and % vegetation, and data collected at a 2km range (landscape) such as Heterogeniety and % semi-nautral land cover. They found that bee abundance and community diversity in locally simple habitats, such as in agricultural sites, saw a positive response to landscape level habitat complexity. The data that I imported from this paper, included all of the bees that they collected (over 12,000) labeled by site and sample period collected, the site data which included the percent cover of bare ground, vegeation, semi-natural habitat, and amount of heterogenous patches around the site, etc., and the plant data, including counts of every species found at each site. 

In the reanalysis I will be calculating the mean abundance at each site, as well as at only the agricultural or grassland sites. I then recreate two of the final linear mixed models from the paper that convey the primary drivers for species abundance and chao richness at the sites. Lastly, I recreate figure 3 from the paper using ggplot to plot various pollinator abundances and richnesses in relation to either % bare ground or plant richness.

Bees<- read_csv("Bee Table Dryad_010119.csv")

## Visualization of Data

```
In the paper that I chose, they included some descriptive statistics such as the overall mean bee abundance found at each site, as well as the mean abundance found at the two management types, argicultural and grassland. These descriptive statistics are calculated and displayed in the chunk below.

## Summary/Discussion

```
I think the descriptive statistics at the beginning, although off by a couple of decimal points, were fairly accurately replicated. One problem I encountered when replicating this was that the data set that I downloaded offline did not have the nesting location (below or above) or size (large or small) in it, but I did find those listings in the supplemental information, but not in an excel sheet, so I had to copy it over to the main bees data sheet. While this was not hard to do, there were a couple of species missing in the supplemental information, so I had to write them in as NAs, which the authors might not have had to do, so that might be why the numbers in the mean abundances were slightly off. 

When creating the linear models, the authors state that they used site nested within city as a random effect, but again the city was not included in the sites dataset as a variable, so I was not able to include this in the model. With that being said, I think that the esitmates from the model in the summary output are pretty close to the actual paper. 

Lastly, with the visualization of firgure 3, I think I was able to recreate this pretty accurately. I did have to go into excel to create pivot tables to rerun the chao estimator on the populations this way. Whehn doing this, if the sites did not have any small or below ground nesting bees, for example, then some of the points were missing from the plot that I think they may have included as zeros.
